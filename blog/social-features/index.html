<p>It is no secret that integrating social features into an app, thereby letting the product become a network, can have an immense impact on retention and growth. Companies like Sport.com have experienced an <a href="http://blog.tapdaq.com/app-marketing/turn-app-community/">increase of 35% in 30 day retention</a> after turning their app into a social network. We see <a href="https://www.tapglue.com/blog/gambify-customer-story/">impressive results amongst our customers</a>, too. Also on an industry level <em>social</em> seems to be highly relevant to drive adoption and loyalty: Localytics - one of the World’s leading mobile analytics providers - reports that <a href="http://info.localytics.com/blog/app-retention-improves">Social Networking apps have the lowest abandonment rates</a> (together with weather apps). </p>

<p>For someone who attempts to create a more social experience around a product or who tries to build a social network from scratch, finding the right user experience and feature set might seem overwhelming. However, if you look more closely into a variety of social products you will notice that there are recurring UX patterns which are surprisingly similar. </p>

<p>To decode the success of social apps we have extracted the 7 most important features and took a closer look. We not only want to explain common patterns and why they are so impactful, but also give examples on what a successful implementation can look like. </p>

<h4 id="1sociallogin">1. Social Login</h4>

<ul>
<li>Accelerates signup process and decreases dropout rates during onboarding</li>
<li>Allows access to valuable user data such as email address, profile picture, interests, likes </li>
<li>Leverages existing social connections to grow the social graph rapidly</li>
<li>Facebook by far the most adopted social login
<img src="http://localhost:2368/blog/content/images/2015/11/Social-Login-2-1.png" alt="alt"></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2userprofiles">2. User Profiles</h4>

<ul>
<li>Improves individual identity and credibility with other users</li>
<li>Stores interests, preferences, personal data, etc.</li>
<li>Common information: profile picture, username, real name, short bio, preferences, location, number of followers/follows/friends, recent activity
<img src="http://localhost:2368/blog/content/images/2015/11/Profiles-2.png" alt="alt"></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="3friendsfollowers">3. Friends/Followers</h4>

<ul>
<li>Creates a user graph in your app</li>
<li>Two major models to establish connections: friends (private network) and following (public network)
<img src="http://localhost:2368/blog/content/images/2015/11/Friends-list-2.png" alt=""></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="4notificationfeed">4. Notification Feed</h4>

<ul>
<li>Makes activity of a user’s network visible in a single view</li>
<li>Drives content discovery through other users</li>
<li>Powerful for retention, especially when combined with push notifications, email and notification icons
<img src="http://localhost:2368/blog/content/images/2015/11/Notifications-2.png" alt=""></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="5newsfeed">5. News Feed</h4>

<ul>
<li>Constant stream of rich content from people or other sources a user is following</li>
<li>Can include user generated content (posts, pictures, videos)</li>
<li>Often includes like and comment functionality</li>
<li>Algorithms can serve as filters to achieve higher relevance </li>
<li>Content recommendations can harvest the data that is collected from the user network
<img src="http://localhost:2368/blog/content/images/2015/11/News-Feed-2-1.png" alt=""></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="6outboundsharing">6. Outbound Sharing</h4>

<ul>
<li>Sharing content to other, established social networks (one to many)</li>
<li>Potential to grow the user base organically</li>
<li>Prominent share buttons are important to drive adoption</li>
<li>Mostly used with native elements of the respective mobile platform
<img src="http://localhost:2368/blog/content/images/2015/11/Outbound-Share-2-2.png" alt=""></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="7invitefriends">7. Invite Friends</h4>

<ul>
<li>Inviting specific people to start using an app (one to one)</li>
<li>Usually personal messaging (“Join me in this app”)</li>
<li>Deferred deep-linking should be leveraged to create a personalized experience for the invitee</li>
<li>Powerful tool for viral growth, when motivation/incentive to invite others is high enough</li>
<li>Common channels for invites are E-Mail, SMS, Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger
<img src="http://localhost:2368/blog/content/images/2015/11/Invite-Friends-2-2.png" alt=""></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="aframeworkforcreatingsocialnetworks">A framework for creating social networks</h4>

<p>When building a social experience into an app, it often might seem like a huge project with a lot of different paths one could take. However, if you analyze how successful companies have turned their product into a network you will notice a common feature set. </p>

<p>There are 7 core features that are the backbone of many social networks: social login, user profiles, friends/follower connections, notifications feed, news feed, outbound sharing and invite friends. </p>

<p>Plenty of successful products have proven how these features can be implemented successfully and at the same time how these features have had a massive impact on user retention, engagement and an app’s organic (or viral) growth. Therefore we consider this as the feature framework that everybody should look into when building a community into their products. </p>
